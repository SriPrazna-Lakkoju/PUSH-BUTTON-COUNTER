DESCRIPTION:
The Push Button Counter is a simple embedded systems project where a digital counter increases each time a button is pressed. It uses a microcontroller like Arduino to read the push button input and display the count on an LCD or OLED screen. A pull-down resistor is used to ensure stable input readings. Debouncing is implemented in code to prevent false triggering. This project helps in understanding digital input, output display interfacing, and basic programming logic. It is commonly used in applications like people counters, product counting systems, and digital scoreboards. It’s an ideal beginner-level project in electronics.

HOW DOES IT WORKS ?
The program starts with the number 0.
You press the button → the number becomes 1.
Press it again → it becomes 2, and so on.
It counts how many times the button was pressed.

COMPONENETS REQUIRED:
Arduino board
Pushbutton
One resistor (10kΩ)
Wires and breadboard
(Optional) LCD or LEDs to show the number

CONNECTIONS:
One side of the button goes to pin 2 on Arduino.
The other side goes to GND.
Use a pull-up resistor (or tell Arduino to use its internal one).
